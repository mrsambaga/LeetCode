/*Table: Customers
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.

Table: Orders
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| customerId  | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
customerId is a foreign key of the ID from the Customers table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.

Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Customers table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Orders table:
+----+------------+
| id | customerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Output: 
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+*/

/* Solution 1 */
SELECT name as Customers
FROM Customers
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT customerId FROM Orders)

/* Solution 2 */
SELECT Name as Customers from Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.Id = Orders.CustomerId
WHERE Orders.CustomerId IS NULL

/*There are multiple solution for this problem. We can use subquerry with NOT IN to find id that's not exist in orders. We also can use LEFT JOIN to join both table
but if id in the right table (Orders) is not exist in the left table (Customers), then dont include it.*/
